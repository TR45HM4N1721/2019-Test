They called it the car for Everyman.



 

                   

Henry Ford himself called it

a car for the "great multitude. "



 

                   

It was functional and simple,

like your sewing machine

or your cast-iron stove.



 

                   

You could learn to drive it

in less than a day,



 

                   

and you could get any color

you wanted, so long as it was black.



 

                   

When Ford first conceived the Model T,

it took 13 hours to assemble.



 

                   

Within five years, he was

turning out a vehicle every 90 seconds.



 

                   

Of course, the real invention wasn't the car;

it was the assembly line that built it.



 

                   

Pretty soon, other businesses

had borrowed the same techniques.



  

                   

Seamstresses became button sewers.



  

                   

Furniture makers

became knob turners.



  

                   

It was the beginning and the end

of imagination...



  

                   

all at the same time.

- Charles, l'm talking to you.

- Hmm?



  

                   

They need spokes,

same as the others.

They oughta make a better spoke.



  

                   

Yeah? Then what

would you do?

It was a land of opportunity.

[ Bird Squawks ]



  

                   

The country was shrinking,

and there was life

to be made out West...



  

                   

for any man with drive

and ambition.

[ Trolley Bell Rings ]



  

                   

If your dream was big enough

and you had the guts to follow it,



  

                   

there was truly a fortune

to be made.

How are you, sir?



  

                   

[ Engine Sputtering,

Steam Hissing ]



  

                   

Damn thing blew on me.

What?



  

                   

It's a Stanley Steamer.

The boiler blew.



  

                   

- Oh?

- Can you fix it?



  

                   

Uh--



  

                   

Sure. Sure, l can fix it.



  

                   

[ Clanking ]



  

                   

[ Sighs ]



  

                   

This is an amazing machine.



  

                   

It's got a two-stroke boiler system...



  

                   

that's heated

by this huge fire grate.



  

                   

l mean, it's--

Well, it's basically

a very small locomotive.



  

                   

Thank you.

Now, l made

some improvements.



  

                   

It wasn't your boiler that was blowing;

it was your bleed valve.



  

                   

So, with increased pressure,

l can see you getting

up to    miles an hour.



  

                   

Really?

Oh, yeah. And if you superheat the excess,

l can see you reaching--



  

                   

Fifty, maybe    miles an hour.

Is that right?



  

                   

Easily. And the thing

of it is, Mr. Coughlin,

you don't feed it,



  

                   

you don't stable it, and unless

you hit a lamppost, the thing's not

gonna get sick and die on ya.



  

                   

- That's funny.

- To tell you the truth,



  

                   

l wouldn't spend more than five dollars

on the best horse in America.
